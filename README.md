# Naive Bayes Assignment

In this assignment we use Naive Bayes (NB) for its two greatest strengths: 
1. Exploration of a data set 
1. Classification of new data based on training data

The databases are not small, so I'm going to share them via a dropbox link.
You should be able to access the file 
[here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mwhd2ktvtnyapwx/nb-assignment-data.zip?dl=0).

When you get that file, just extract the contents manually into the same
folder as this repository. 

## Part 1: Exploratory Naive Bayes

In this section, you will build a Naïve Bayes classifier on the convention speeches, using the words of the speech text to predict the party (either Republican or Democratic). Your starting notebook walks you through the steps of fitting and using a Naïve Bayes model from the NLTK package. This repo includes some code that would help you limit the number of words you consider in your model, which might improve run-time. We have asked you to fill in some observations from the fitted model.

## Part 2: Classifying Tweets

We have a pretty gigantic database of tweets (and other data) from 
everyone running for congress in 2018. As an exercise, we'll try to 
use this convention model to classify those tweets. 

The notebook walks you through the steps in broad terms: 
1. Pull data from the congressional DB.
1. Clean, tokenize, and build your feature dictionary for a tweet.
1. Use the classifier from Part 1 to estimate the party of the tweeter.
1. Compare this estimate to their actual party.
